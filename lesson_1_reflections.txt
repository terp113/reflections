What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
When you manually commit you can group sectional and logical changes instead of temporal modification which maybe unrelated.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Git and others are more esatblsihed for programming then other programs focused on word processing and photos

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
can use command prompt or git bash . move the directory. then type git log to reveal all changes, q to quit.
then git diff 4### 4###. then scroll to see all changes

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

you can always revert back to a work version of the program

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
I want to use it for the android app dvelopment course
